Project: Build Your Own Custom Chatbot

In this project I will change the default dataset to build my own custom chatbot. You will build the chatbot manually using just basic packages like openai and pandas, 
not using frameworks like LangChain, in order to gain a deeper understanding of how these systems work "under the hood".

I will have a custom OpenAI chatbot using a scenario...... I will be responsible for selecting a data source, explaining why the data source is appropriate for the task, 
incorporating the data source into the custom chatbot code, and writing questions to demonstrate the performance of the custom prompt.
