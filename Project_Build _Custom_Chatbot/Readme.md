Project: Build Your Own Custom Chatbot

In this project I will change the default dataset to build my own custom chatbot. You will build the chatbot manually using just basic packages like openai and pandas, 
not using frameworks like LangChain, in order to gain a deeper understanding of how these systems work "under the hood".

My scenario is synthesizers, I am will be responsible for selecting a data source (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer)
I will strip down data and turn it into embeddings - DONE
Then use use an OpenAI Embedding model, "text-embedding-ada-002" to embedded my question - DONE
Calculated cosine distances between the question and the dataset I created from the Wikipeda - DONE
   incorporating the data source into the custom chatbot code, and writing questions to demonstrate the performance of the custom prompt.
And get an answer - WIP(Close)
